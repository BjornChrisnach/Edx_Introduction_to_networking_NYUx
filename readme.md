- Edx course from NYUx, part 2 of Micro bachelor
- part 1, I allready did, was Basics of Computing and Programming FCS.PRG.1, can be found in my repositories.
- part 2 or 3 is Computer hardware and operation system, FCS.OS.1  
- part 2 or 3, Introduction to networking, FCS.NET.1

- This is a very theoretically course, not much to add to the repository. Anyway, I Finished the audit I did of the course.
- And I allready learned this stuff with my HBO(Bachelor) education as Programmer-Analist from CVO Antwerp Belgium.
- But I want to do the next in line courses from NYUx after these 3 are done. They say it's best to first take these 3 courses.
